LaunchSUV FLASK BOILERPLATE

Launch your solution as fast as possible
The Boilerplate with all the necessary features a Kenyan developer needs to launch their solution
Imagine you want to build a cool clubhouse, but building it from scratch would take a lot of time and effort. 
Instead, you use a pre-built club house that already has most of the parts you need and customize it to your own requirements.
This pre-built club house is like a "boilerplate" in web development.
It's a ready-made starter pack that helps you build websites quickly.

When you use a boilerplate for web development, it’s like getting a pre-built clubhouse that already has the door with a lock (user auth), a big cupboard for storing stuff (database), a nice welcome mat (landing page), and a cash register (payment integration). You can then focus on decorating it and adding your own special touches, rather than starting from scratch.
This saves a lot of time and makes it easier to build a website that works well.

### User Authentication (User Auth)
Think of user authentication like the clubhouse door that only lets in members who have the right key. When someone wants to join your website, they have to prove who they are by entering a username and password. If their key (password) matches the lock (what's stored in the database), they can come in.

### Working Database
A database is like a big, organized cupboard inside your clubhouse where you store all important information. For a website, this might be users' names, passwords, and other details. It helps keep everything neat and easy to find.

### Landing Page
The landing page is the front door and welcome mat of your clubhouse. It's the first thing people see when they visit your website. You want it to look nice and be welcoming, so people know they’ve come to the right place and can learn about what you offer.

### Payment Integration
Payment integration is like having a cash register in your clubhouse. If you want to sell snacks or collect membership fees, you need a way to accept money. On a website, this means setting up a system where people can safely enter their payment details and you can receive the money.
